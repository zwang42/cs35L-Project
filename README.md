# FitGram Web App

FitGram is a web application that has been developed as a way for users to share information about their fitness journeys. It allows for users to benchmark their statistics against others in terms of categories such as benchpress and mile times amongst others. Users are also able to navigate and search for other users, and follow their friends. Users are also able to post about their journey, in the form of a picture followed by a caption. There is a homepage that displays these posts and others are allowed to both comment and like the post to show their support.
